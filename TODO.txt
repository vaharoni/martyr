Add ability to define default group by clause that is added to the query and facts without being considered as grain.

Use case:
  Admin::MartyrSchema::CandidateOffersCube.slice('session.id', with: 10)
  -> Due to all the custom rollups that are dependent on job_offer.status

Add ability to add includes directive to an existing dimension scope.

Add ability to sort results

============================

- QueryContext currently only supports one #slice operation. It should really return a decorator of itself that allies
  the memory slice on it.

- The #for_cube_name method on both memory slices and data slices is dangerous - once the block returns the object's
  scoping is useless. Create either one decorator for both, or a different decorator for each one that acts as a filter.

- Coordinate currently communicate with the memory slice in order to reset and set its values. This is useless, memory
  slice should be immutable to the cells, otherwise custom rollups that reset dimension level on a memory slice 2:
  <data slice 1> + <memory slice 2> will return a different value than the same custom rollup on data slice 3:
  <data slice 3> = <data slice 1> + <memory slice 2> though they should be the same.

  E.g., the rollup:
  has_custom_rollup :usa_amount, ->(fact_set) { fact_set.locate('customers.country', with: 'USA')['amount'] }

  Will have different result for these two:
  Cube.slice('customers.country', with: 'France').build   # => rollup will not be able to locate USA element
  Cube.build.slice('customers.country', with: 'France')   # => rollup will be able to locate USA element

- Virtual cube builder needs fixing. The #build method with all combinations is not working right. It should be
  transitioned to something more performing that does not rely on all possible combinations.

- Coordinate, ElementLocator and FactIndexer all do things very similar. Why do we need ElementLocator when we have
  FactIndexer? Does Coordinates really need to know about MemorySlice? Can ElementLocator have an #all method?


  If memory slice is immutable, while FactIndexer holds all facts and is able to address multiple memory slices,
  it makes sense to have an element locator that is cube-specific and memory-slice-specific, so the user does not need
  to provide the memory slice every time a cell is needed.
  In this case, the locator is injected to the element to perform location search operations.

  Coordinates does not need to contain a memory slice. Any attempt to go outside the slice will yield an empty cell.
  So it's simply a hash. We can further remove the knowledge of coordinates about what is a level and what is a
  metric by having this be resolved by the ElementLocator (it has to know fact indexer anyways).

  VirtualElement #locate will continue to be as today - delegating to the individual locators.

  VirtualElementBuilder can be simplified - it can simply be provided with the locators, which now will know how to
  fetch all elements if necessary. --> Although: locator should not hold the level ids.. elements grain is really
  based on the pivot grain which can be different than the sub cube grain, and can change dynamically based on whether
  totals are calculated. So perhaps it's better to have the locator be unrelated to the #elements operation.
  Actually, it can be injected into elements instead of memory slice!

  Standardization of metric names can be moved to the locator too, so "dirty" user input is handled in one place.

- Due to the way the grain is initialized in cubes, I'm not sure if currently a virtual cube containing 2 cubes one
  of which contains one more detailed level of granularity is going to work (select_supported_level_ids selects
  all levels in supported dimensions, regardless of whether the level itself can actually be fetched)
